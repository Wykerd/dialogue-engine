$otherVariable = Markus

$characterName < What's your name?

Daniel: Hey, I'm $characterName, and I may also include scripting, {
    vm.getVariable('characterName').toLowerCase()
}, which will be replaced with the evaluated result.

Tom: Hey $characterName! What are you doing here?

$route
? fight "I'm looking for a fight!"
? drink "I'm looking for a drink!"

Tom: Well, you chose $route. I'm not sure what that means, but I'm sure it's important.

Daniel: Do you know where I can find $otherVariable?
